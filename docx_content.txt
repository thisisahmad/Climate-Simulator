I am seeking a highly skilled freelancer to develop an advanced, interactive business simulation tool that compares the financial performance of sustainable versus traditional business strategies over a 5 to 10-year horizon. 
Project Overview: 
Objective: Create a dynamic simulator that allows real-time comparison between two scenarios: (as far as I can see it’s not dynamic at all because if you put new inputs are bugged)
Scenario A: Traditional business operations. 
Scenario B: Integration of sustainability initiatives. 
Platform Preference: Excel (with dynamic arrays), Google Sheets, or a no-code web application. 
Inspiration: The En-ROADS Simulator by MIT Climate Interactive, known for its clean interface and real-time feedback. (there are not enough graphs as promised.)
Key Requirements: 
1. User Inputs: 
Initial Revenue o 	Number of Employees o 	Fixed Costs (EUR/year) o 	Variable Costs (% of Revenue) o 	Initial Capital Expenditure (Capex) o 	Operating Margin (%) o 	Annual Revenue Growth Rate (%) o 	Annual Employee Growth Rate (%) o 	Forecast Horizon (5, 7, or 10 years) 
2. Sustainability Investments (Scenario B only): 
Sustainability Capex (one-time investment) o 	Percentage of Revenue Reinvested Annually in Sustainability o 	Annual Savings from: 
Energy Efficiency (% of Operating Costs) 
Resource Efficiency (% of Variable Costs) 
Waste Reduction (% of Operating Costs) 
Circular Economy Initiatives (% cost reduction) o 	Additional Revenue Uplift due to: 
Green Reputation (% increase in Revenue Growth) 
Access to New Green Markets (% added to Revenue) o 	Operational Metrics: 
Reduction in Employee Turnover Rate (%) 
Productivity Increase from Green Workplace (%) o Government Subsidies / Tax Incentives (flat value or % of Capex) 
3. Advanced Financial Settings: 
Corporate Tax Rate (%) o 	Discount Rate (%) for Net Present Value (NPV) o 	Inflation Rate (%) o 	Depreciation Period for Sustainability Investments (Years) 
Processing Logic: 
For each year in the forecast horizon, the simulator should calculate: 
Revenue_t = Revenue_(t-1) × (1 + Growth Rate + Green Market Growth + Reputation Impact) 
Operating Costs_t = Revenue_t × Variable Cost % + Fixed Costs 
Savings_t = (Energy Saving + Resource Saving + Waste Reduction + Circular Economy Saving) × Operating Costs_t 
Depreciation = Sustainability Capex / Depreciation Years 
EBITDA_t = Revenue_t - Operating Costs_t + Sustainability Savings_t - Depreciation 
EBIT_t = EBITDA_t - Depreciation 
Taxable Income_t = EBIT_t 
Net Profit_t = Taxable Income_t × (1 - Corporate Tax Rate) 
Cumulative Net Profit = Sum of Net Profit_t 
Cumulative Sustainability Investment = Initial Capex + Annual Sustainability Spending 
Cumulative Savings = Sum of Sustainability Savings_t 
Cumulative ROI = (Cumulative Net Profit + Cumulative Savings) / Cumulative Sustainability Investment 
NPV = Sum(Net Profit_t / (1 + Discount Rate)^t) 
Payback Year: Year when Cumulative Net Profit + Cumulative Savings ≥ Cumulative Sustainability Investment 
Outputs: 
Comparative Graphs (Scenario A vs. Scenario B): 
Revenue over time o 	Operating Costs over time o 	Net Profit over time o 	Sustainability Savings over time o 	ROI over time o 	Payback Period visualization 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
Final ROI o 	Cumulative Net Profit o 	Total Sustainability Savings o 	Payback Year o 	NPV 
Summary Text Outputs: 
"Scenario B achieves payback in Year X." o 	"Cumulative Net Profit in Scenario B exceeds Scenario A by EUR Y after 10 years." o 	"ROI in Scenario B at Year 10 is Z% higher." You made this static, not good.
Design Requirements: 
Dashboard-style layout: 
Left panel: Inputs o 	Right panel: Outputs (Graphs, KPIs) 
Real-time updates without macros or external plugins. There are none working correctly.
Inputs should utilize dropdowns and sliders where applicable. 
Clean, professional, and minimalistic design inspired by En-ROADS. 
Formulas must be protected (locked cells) in the final version. 
Provide both: 
Editable version (open) o 	Locked version (protected) 
Deliverables: 
Fully functioning simulator (Excel, Google Sheets, or Web App). 
Editable source file. 
Locked version for final use. 
User manual (brief guide on how to use the simulator). 
Timeline: 
Please confirm feasibility based on this brief. 
Provide estimated delivery time and fixed total cost. 
Additional Notes: 
The simulator must eliminate the need for manual estimation by offering intelligent defaults and dropdown selections. 
e.g.  

 
It must be interactive, highly intuitive, and visually clear to support SME managers in strategic sustainable investment decisions. 
Design standard: En-ROADS — Clean, interactive, scenario-driven, no technical background required. 
Looking forward to your proposal.
